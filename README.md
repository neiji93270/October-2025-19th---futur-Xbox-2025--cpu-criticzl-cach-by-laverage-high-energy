It IS n'est to set treshold for a range of values diffère from 10^15 eV or keV. Then WE set 12 eV. So thé cou IS largeur but diffère from 10eV systèms. This means that  refresh fréquences of gdderam IS controlled by cpu. Then, shaders are more complexe but realtime high FPS fail. Thé ps6 CPU seems more power full.
